========================
 Login Page Redirection 
========================

By default Flectra redirects portal users on `/my` portal dashboard after their success login.
This module makes redirection to the same page from where logging in process were initiated.

No special settings is needed, just install the module.

Typical usage of the module.
============================

For example, you are on the `/blog` page and click `Sign in` button to log in.
After you log in you'll see the same `/blog` (or any other page you were at) page instead of `/my`.
