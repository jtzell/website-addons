=======================
 Customer Event Portal
=======================

Allows to customers see tickets for events at Portal.

* Only confirmed tickets with attendee_partner_id as current user are shown

Additional features:

* Ticket transferring feature

  * To decrease chance of transferring to a wrong email, partner with the email must exist before transferring.
  * New *When to Run* values for Email Schedule:

    * transferring_started
    * transferring_finished

  * New attendee receives email with a link to finish ticket transferring

* Tracks changes in key registration fields (via ``track_visibility='onchange'``)

* Tickets can be changed to other products (including other tickets)

  * When old ticket is canceled, a message with a reference to new Sale Order is posted

Relation to other modules
=========================

website_event_refund
--------------------

Ticket refunding feature based on ``website_event_refund`` module

website_event_attendee_signup
-----------------------------

It's recommended to use the module with ``website_event_attendee_signup`` which creates user for each attendee on registration.

website_event_attendee_fields
-----------------------------

We need this modules for autofill feature. Other features of the modules are optional.

website
-------

The module is not splitted in two where one doesn't depend on website how it's usually done (e.g. ``portal_event_tickets`` and ``website_portal_event_tickets``), because since 11.0 there is no such separation.

event_sale
----------

We don't split module in two where one doesn't depend on ``event_sale`` (e.g. ``portal_event_tickets`` and ``portal_event_tickets_sale``) for following reasons:

* it simplifies development and maintainance
* we don't consider portal module without ``event_sale`` as popular
* free events are still usable even if ``event_sale`` module is installed

portal_event
============

``portal_event`` should be more proper name for this module, but it's occupied by repository flectra/flectra and which makes it impossible to use it in flectra apps store.
